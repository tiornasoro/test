I want to be a data scientist

 I am interested in data science because it's the present and futur business.

### This code will calcute the discriminant of polynom 


```python
a=3
b=4
c=6
dis=b*b-(4*a*c)
print('the discriminant is:',dis)
```

    the discriminant is: -56
    

 A data scientist must now:
     . statistics
     . informatics
     . mathmatics
     
 and can be from :
     1-mathmatics studies
     2-engineer studies
     3-computer sciences
     
 all of this  is on : https://www.coursera.org/


```python

```
